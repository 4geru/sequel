= Testing with Sequel

Whether or not you use Sequel in your application, you are usually going to want to have tests that ensure that your code works.  When you are using Sequel, it's helpful to integrate it into your testing framework, and it's generally best to run each test in its own transaction if possible.  That keeps all tests isolated from each other, and it's simple as it handles all of the cleanup for you.  Sequel doesn't ship with helpers for common libraries, as the exact code you need is often application-specific, but this page offers some examples that you can either use directly or build on.

== Transactional tests

These run each test in its own transaction, the recommended way to test.

=== RSpec 1

  class Spec::Example::ExampleGroup
    def execute(*args, &block)
      x = nil
      Sequel::Model.db.transaction{x = super(*args, &block); raise Sequel::Rollback}
      x
    end
  end

=== RSpec 2

  class Spec::Example::ExampleGroup
    around do |example|
      Sequel::Model.db.transaction{example.call; raise Sequel::Rollback}
    end
  end

=== Test::Unit

  # Must use this class as the base class for your tests
  class SequelTestCase < Test::Unit::TestCase
    def run(*args, &block)
      Sequel::Model.db.transaction do
        super
        raise Sequel::Rollback
      end
    end
  end

== Nontransactional tests

In some cases, it is not possible to use transactions.  For example, if you are testing a web application that is running in a separate process, you don't have access to that process's database connections, so you can't run your examples in transactions.  In that case, the best way to handle things is to cleanup after each test by deleting or truncating the database tables used in the test.

The order in which you delete/truncate the tables is important if you are using referential integrity in your database (which you probably should be doing).  If you are using referential integrity, you need to make sure to delete in tables referencing other tables before the tables that are being referenced.  For example, if you have an +albums+ table with an +artist_id+ field referencing the +artists+ table, you want to delete/truncate the +albums+ table before the +artists+ table.  Note that if you have cyclic references in your database, you will probably need to write your own custom cleaning code.

=== RSpec

  class Spec::Example::ExampleGroup
    after do
      [:table1, :table2].each{|x| Sequel::Model.db.from(x).truncate}
      # or
      [:table1, :table2].each{|x| Sequel::Model.db.from(x).delete}
    end
  end

=== Test::Unit

  # Must use this class as the base class for your tests
  class SequelTestCase < Test::Unit::TestCase
    def teardown
      [:table1, :table2].each{|x| Sequel::Model.db.from(x).truncate}
      # or
      [:table1, :table2].each{|x| Sequel::Model.db.from(x).delete}
    end
  end

= Testing Sequel Itself

Sequel has multiple separate test suites.  All test suites run under either RSpec 1 or RSpec 2.

== rake spec

The +spec+ rake task (which is also the default rake task) runs Sequel's core and model specs.  These specs use a mocked database connection, and test for specific SQL used and for generally correct behavior.

== rake spec_plugin

The +spec_plugin+ rake task runs the specs for the plugins and extensions that ship with Sequel.  These also use a mocked database connection, and operate very similarly to the general Sequel core and model specs.

== rake spec_<i>adapter</i> (e.g. rake spec_postgres)

The <tt>spec_<i>adapter</i></tt> specs run against a real database connection with nothing mocked, and test for correct results.  They are much slower than the standard specs, but they will catch errors that are mocked out by the default specs, as well show issues that only occur on a certain database, adapter, interpreter, or some combination of those.

These specs are broken down into two parts.  For each database, there are specific specs that only apply to that database, and these are called the adapter specs.  There are also shared specs that apply to all (or almost all) databases, these are called the integration specs.

== Environment variables

Sequel often uses environment variables when testing to specify either the database to be tested or specify how testing should be done.

=== Connection Strings

The following environment variables specify Database connection URL strings:

* SEQUEL_INTEGRATION_URL: integration specs
* SEQUEL_FB_SPEC_DB: firebird adapter specs
* SEQUEL_MSSQL_SPEC_DB: mssql adapter specs
* SEQUEL_PG_SPEC_DB: postgres adapter specs
* SEQUEL_SQLITE_SPEC_DB: sqlite adapter specs
* SEQUEL_MY_SPEC_DB: mysql adapter specs
* SEQUEL_DB2_SPEC_DB: db2 adapter specs

=== Other

* SEQUEL_MSSQL_SPEC_REQUIRE: Separate file to require when running mssql adapter specs
* SEQUEL_DB2_SPEC_REQUIRE: Separate file to require when running db2 adapter specs
* SEQUEL_COLUMNS_INTROSPECTION: Whehter to run the specs with the columns_introspection extension loaded by default
* SEQUEL_NO_PENDING: Don't mark any specs as pending, try running all specs
* SKIPPED_TEST_WARN: Warn when skipping any tests because libraries aren't available
