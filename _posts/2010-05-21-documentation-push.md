 title: Documentation Push

When I asked the Sequel mailing list a month ago about <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sequel-talk/browse_thread/thread/b7850930a3aa93db">possible additions to Sequel</a>, the main response I got was the need for better documentation.  One of the reasons that this blog was dormant for about a month was I was very busy writing documentation.  I still have a lot of documentation I plan to write, but there have been a lot of positive changes made since then.  Some were done before 3.11.0 and are available on the Sequel website, such as:

* <a href="/rdoc/files/doc/dataset_basics_rdoc.html">A new Dataset Basics guide</a>
* <a href="/rdoc/files/doc/association_basics_rdoc.html">A new Association Basics guide</a>
* <a href="/rdoc/files/doc/virtual_rows_rdoc.html">A revamped Virtual Rows guide</a>
* <a href="/rdoc/classes/Sequel/Dataset.html">RDoc Section support for the Sequel::Dataset RDoc documentation</a>

Since 3.11.0, there has been more documentation added:

* <a href="http://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel/blob/master/doc/querying.rdoc">A Querying in Sequel guide</a>
* <a href="http://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel/blob/master/doc/migration.rdoc">A Migration and Schema Modification guide</a> to replace the previous Schema Modification Guide
* <a href="http://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel/blob/master/doc/model_hooks.rdoc">A Model Hooks guide</a>
* <a href="http://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel/blob/master/doc/validations.rdoc">A Model Validations guide</a>
* <a href="http://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel/blob/master/doc/sql.rdoc">A Sequel for SQL Users guide</a>
* <a href="http://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel/blob/master/doc/active_record.rdoc">A Sequel for ActiveRecord Users guide</a>

I'd like to thank <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org">RailsGuides</a>, as I borrowed the basic format for the Association Basics, Querying in Sequel, Model Hooks, Model Validations, and Migration and Schema Modification guides from their guides.
