 title: Sequel 3.18.0 Released
---

Sequel 3.18.0 was released today!  <a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/release_notes/3_18_0_txt.html">Full release notes are available</a>, but here are some highlights:

* Reversible migration support was added, so simple migrations can be reversed automatically.
* A to_dot extension was added, for easier creation of visualizations of dataset abstract syntax trees.
* The user can now control how access to uncofigured shards is handled.

I currently don't have any major plans for 3.19.0.  As always, I'll certainly fix bugs and consider feature requests submitted from the community.
