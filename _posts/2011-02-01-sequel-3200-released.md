 title: Sequel 3.20.0 Released
---

Sequel 3.20.0 was released today!  <a href="/rdoc/files/doc/release_notes/3_20_0_txt.html">Full release notes are available</a>, but here are some highlights:

* The swift adapter was updated to support swift 0.8.1.
* The swift adapter now supports SQLite.
* Arbitrary JDBC properties can be set in the jdbc adapter.
* The ado adapter now has basic Microsoft Access support.

I currently only have a few minor features in mind for 3.21.0.  As always, I'll certainly fix bugs and consider feature requests submitted from the community.
