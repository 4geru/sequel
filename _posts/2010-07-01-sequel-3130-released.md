 title: Sequel 3.13.0 Released
---

Sequel 3.13.0 was released today!  <a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/release_notes/3_13_0_txt.html">Full release notes are available</a>, but here are some highlights:

* Sequel now supports Ruby 1.9.2pre3.
* Sequel now supports prepared transactions/2-phase commit.
* Sequel now supports customizable transaction isolation levels.
* Sequel now ships with built-in plugins for serializing/deserializing model datasets and instances to/from JSON and XML.
* Sequel now ships with built-in tree and list plugins.

Not much is currently planned for 3.14.0. As always, I'll certainly fix bugs and consider feature requests submitted from the community.
