 title: Sequel 3.19.0 Released
---

Sequel 3.19.0 was released today!  <a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/release_notes/3_19_0_txt.html">Full release notes are available</a>, but here are some highlights:

* Type conversion is up to 15% faster in some adapters.
* The validation_class_methods plugin now uses reflectable validations.
* The add_* association method now takes a primary key argument.
* Prepared statements/bound variables now take a wider variety of arguments.

I currently don't have any major plans for 3.20.0.  As always, I'll certainly fix bugs and consider feature requests submitted from the community.
