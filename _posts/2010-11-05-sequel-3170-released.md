 title: Sequel 3.17.0 Released
---

Sequel 3.17.0 was released today!  <a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/files/doc/release_notes/3_17_0_txt.html">Full release notes are available</a>, but here are some highlights:

* By popular demand, you can now change the log level Sequel uses for SQL statements.
* You can now connect to MySQL over SSL in the native MySQL adapter.
* Many improvements were made to the swift adapter and the AS400 jdbc subadapter.

I currently don't have any major plans for 3.18.0.  As always, I'll certainly fix bugs and consider feature requests submitted from the community.
