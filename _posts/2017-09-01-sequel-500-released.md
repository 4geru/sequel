---

Sequel 5.0.0 was released today!  <a href="/rdoc/files/doc/release_notes/5_0_0_txt.html">Full release notes are available</a>, but here are some highlights:

* Datasets are now frozen by default.
* Symbol splitting is now disabled by default.
* Sequel no longer treats plain strings passed to filtering methods as SQL code fragments.

In the future, only major release announcements will be posted on the Sequel blog.  For minor release announcements, please see <a href="/documentation.html">the documentation page</a>.
